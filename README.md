## German currency ZPC introduction
Relying on the research strength of Aachen University of Technology, in the context of the German Industry 4.0 revolution, under the joint efforts of the German Commercial Bank and the German IPC company, industrial, trade and financial cooperation was integrated into the innovative industrial trade blockchain 4.0 technology and established. The world's first blockchain industrial application of the international decentralized system - ZPC.

An ecosystem of companies, researchers and public agencies is emerging. ZPC helps promote industrial Internet applications and accelerates the development of blockchain technology in industrial trade. It will support the interoperability of various industrial trading environments. Establish, make the world's relations become closer.
Specifically, ZPC is an emerging manufacturing ecosystem that brings together strategic economic and social applications of technology and low-cost solutions to the multi-link challenges in production and trade, resulting in an unprecedented efficient exchange for multi-party transactions. ZPC has completely changed the production and living, economic and social forms of the Internet, and innovation has promoted the development and extension of a new generation of information technologies such as Internet of Things, cloud computing and big data to seize the commanding height of strategic competition in manufacturing digital transformation.

At present, ZPC has established financial conglomerates with some of the world's top industrial enterprises such as Commerzbank, IPC, Siemens, Daimler, BMW, ThyssenKrupp Group, Bosch, Bayer, Henkel and Mann Group Long-term stable relations of cooperation. Introduce the latest blockchain technology to the manufacturing industry and improve the operation efficiency and information flow of placing orders, purchasing, logistics, receiving, accepting and payment based on distributed ledger and smart contracts of blockchain technology, Closed loops of information flow, commodity flow, and capital flow have become the first entrance to global factories, industrial products, and market users.

As the digital currency system of the world's most advanced blockchain technology, we delve into various possibilities in application scenarios and fully consider people's every need. We define R&D, design, and production with intelligence, safety, efficiency, and convenience. Manufacturing, product distribution and after-sales services, etc., on the basis of digitalization, information, and intelligence, through a unified cloud operating platform, enable producers to purchase raw materials at the lowest cost, so that consumers can directly shop from manufacturers. And the direct use of ZPC tokens transactions, the speed, breadth, depth unprecedented. Can bring tangible benefits, not only for the benefit of any organization, but also for the benefit of all mankind.

Given the importance of this technology, the German government annually invests more than 100 million euros in research related to the ZPC system, linking physical objects to the full power of cyberspace and dramatically changing the way humans interact with technology. The German government looks forward to working with public-private partnerships such as the ZPC to transform innovative industrial Internet products and systems into new drivers for smart manufacturing, logistics and global trade.

With the development of new ideas, new knowledge, and new technologies, we are convinced that ZPC can more easily connect and optimize assets, operations, and data to increase flexibility and release the commercial value of all industrial fields. The wider its development and applications, the more systematic alternatives. The stronger the sexes, the more disruptive the existing global industrial trade will be, eventually achieving a reverse industrialization and a better future

## ZPC简介
依托亚琛工业大学的科研实力，在德国工业4.0革命的背景下，在德国商业银行与德国IPC公司联合助力下，将工业、贸易和金融合作融入创新的工业贸易区块链4.0技术中，建立全球首个区块链工业应用项目的国际性去中心化系统——ZPC。

一个由企业、科研人员和公共机构组成的生态系统正在形成，ZPC以帮助推动工业互联网应用，加快区块链技术在工业贸易中发展为基本元素，它将支持各种工业贸易环境互操作性的建立，使世界的联系变得更加密切。

具体来说，ZPC是一种新兴制造业生态系统，将战略性技术布局经济社会应用，低成本解决生产、贸易中多环节难题，为多方交易带来前所未有的高效交换。ZPC彻底改变了生产生活、经济社会的互联网形态，创新推动了物联网、云计算、大数据等新一代信息技术的延伸和发展，抢占制造业数字化转型战略竞争的制高点。

目前，ZPC与德国商业银行、德国IPC公司、西门子、戴姆勒、宝马、蒂森克虏伯集团、博世集团、拜耳集团、汉高集团、曼恩集团等世界顶级工业企业、金融财团建立了长期稳固的合作关系。向制造业引入最新区块链技术，以区块链技术的分布式账本与智能合约为基础，提高下单、采购、物流、收货、验收、付款的操作效率与信息流转，打通供应链在信息流、商品流、资金流的闭环，成为集聚全球工厂、工业产品、市场用户的第一入口。

作为世界上最先进区块链技术的数字货币系统，我们深入研究在应用场景中的各种可能，充分考虑了人们的每种需要，我们以智能、安全、高效、便捷来定义研发设计、生产制造、产品流通与售后服务等，在实现数字化、信息化和智能化的基础上，通过一个统一的云操作平台，使生产者能最低成本采购原材料，使消费者能够直接从生产商那里购物，而且直接用ZPC代币进行交易，其速度、广度、深度前所未有。能够带来实实在在的利益，不仅可以造福于任何组织，而且还能造福于全人类。

鉴于这项技术的重要性，德国政府每年将为ZPC系统的相关研究投资超过1亿欧元，将物理对象与网络空间的全部力量相连接，大幅改变人类与技术的互动方式。德国政府期待携手像ZPC这样的公私合作团体，把创新的工业互联网产品和系统转化成智能制造、物流运输和全球贸易领域的新动力。

新思想、新知识和新技术的集成发展，我们深信ZPC能够更便利地连接和优化资产、操作及数据，以提高灵活性，释放所有工业领域的商业价值,其发展和应用越广泛，系统替代性越强，对现有全球工业贸易的颠覆性也越强，最终实现逆工业化，缔造更美好未来
